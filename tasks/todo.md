# RayVitals Backend API Development Plan

## Overview
Starting with the backend API as the foundation, since all WordPress plugin functionality depends on it. This plan focuses on creating a minimal viable API that can perform basic website audits and provide simple testing capabilities.

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure (High Priority)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository with initial backend API structure
- [ ] Create FastAPI project structure with basic configuration
- [ ] Set up Supabase database connection and basic schema
- [ ] Create basic website audit endpoints (POST /audit/start, GET /audit/status)

### Phase 2: Basic Audit Capabilities (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement simple security scan (SSL check, basic headers)
- [ ] Add basic performance testing (simple page load metrics)
- [ ] Create simple AI integration for basic website analysis summary
- [ ] Set up async job processing with Celery + Redis

### Phase 3: Testing & Development Tools (Low Priority)
- [ ] Create API testing suite and simple web interface for testing
- [ ] Add Docker setup for local development

## Quick Testing Strategy

Once basic endpoints are established, we'll create:
1. **Simple HTTP client tests** using pytest + requests
2. **Basic web interface** (single HTML page) to trigger scans and view results
3. **Postman/curl examples** for manual API testing
4. **Health check endpoints** to verify all services are working

## Technology Stack (From Spec)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Queue**: Celery + Redis
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **External APIs**: Various audit services (SSL Labs, PageSpeed, etc.)

## Success Criteria for MVP
- API can receive a website URL and return an audit ID
- Basic security and performance checks complete successfully
- Results stored in Supabase and retrievable via API
- Simple AI summary generated from audit results
- All endpoints documented and testable

## Progress Update

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up GitHub repository with initial backend API structure
- [x] Create FastAPI project structure with basic configuration
- [x] Create basic website audit endpoints (POST /audit/start, GET /audit/status)
- [x] Implement simple security scan (SSL check, basic headers)
- [x] Add basic performance testing (simple page load metrics)
- [x] Create simple AI integration for basic website analysis summary
- [x] Create API testing suite and simple web interface for testing
- [x] Add Docker setup for local development

### ⏳ Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Set up Supabase database connection and basic schema
- [ ] Set up async job processing with Celery + Redis

## Review

### Changes Made
1. **Created comprehensive FastAPI backend structure** with modular design
2. **Implemented custom security and performance scanning** following the API sources analysis strategy
3. **Added Google Gemini AI integration** for business intelligence analysis
4. **Built complete audit workflow** with async processing support
5. **Created Docker setup** for easy local development
6. **Added comprehensive testing interface** (test_interface.html) for manual API testing
7. **Set up proper database models** for Supabase integration
8. **Implemented fallback strategies** for all external dependencies

### Key Features Implemented
- **Security Analysis**: Custom SSL, headers, and vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Load time measurement, HTTP response analysis
- **AI Business Intelligence**: Gemini-powered analysis with fallback summaries
- **Async Processing**: Background task architecture (ready for Celery)
- **Health Monitoring**: Detailed health checks for all services
- **Testing Interface**: Simple web UI for testing all endpoints

### Architecture Decisions
- **Custom implementations over external APIs** for core functionality (security, performance)
- **Modular service architecture** for easy extension and testing
- **Comprehensive error handling** with structured logging
- **Docker-first development** for consistent environments
- **Database-agnostic design** with Supabase as primary choice

### Next Steps
To complete the MVP, you'll need to:
1. **Set up Supabase project** and configure database connection
2. **Add Celery worker setup** for production async processing
3. **Create GitHub repository** (needs GitHub CLI authentication)
4. **Test full workflow** with real database

The backend is now ready for testing and can be deployed to Digital Ocean or Vultr once the remaining database setup is complete.
