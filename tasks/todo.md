# RayVitals Backend API Development Plan

## Overview
Starting with the backend API as the foundation, since all WordPress plugin functionality depends on it. This plan focuses on creating a minimal viable API that can perform basic website audits and provide simple testing capabilities.

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure (High Priority)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository with initial backend API structure
- [ ] Create FastAPI project structure with basic configuration
- [ ] Set up Supabase database connection and basic schema
- [ ] Create basic website audit endpoints (POST /audit/start, GET /audit/status)

### Phase 2: Basic Audit Capabilities (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement simple security scan (SSL check, basic headers)
- [ ] Add basic performance testing (simple page load metrics)
- [ ] Create simple AI integration for basic website analysis summary
- [ ] Set up async job processing with Celery + Redis

### Phase 3: Testing & Development Tools (Low Priority)
- [ ] Create API testing suite and simple web interface for testing
- [ ] Add Docker setup for local development

## Quick Testing Strategy

Once basic endpoints are established, we'll create:
1. **Simple HTTP client tests** using pytest + requests
2. **Basic web interface** (single HTML page) to trigger scans and view results
3. **Postman/curl examples** for manual API testing
4. **Health check endpoints** to verify all services are working

## Technology Stack (From Spec)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Queue**: Celery + Redis
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **External APIs**: Various audit services (SSL Labs, PageSpeed, etc.)

## Success Criteria for MVP
- API can receive a website URL and return an audit ID
- Basic security and performance checks complete successfully
- Results stored in Supabase and retrievable via API
- Simple AI summary generated from audit results
- All endpoints documented and testable

## Progress Update

# Database URL Duplication Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
- DigitalOcean has duplicate DATABASE_URL environment variables
- One encrypted DATABASE_URL that overrides app-level variable
- Another DATABASE_URL with value `${rayvitals-postgres.DATABASE_URL}`
- App-level DATABASE_URL is being overridden (marked as overridden)
- This can cause connection conflicts and unpredictable behavior

## Current Database URL Usage
- Used in `/app/core/config.py` for settings configuration
- Used in `/app/core/database.py` for SQLAlchemy async engine creation
- Critical for Supabase PostgreSQL connection
- Required for audit storage, user management, and result storage

## Todo Items

### Investigation Tasks
- [ ] Verify which DATABASE_URL is currently being used by the application
- [ ] Check if the managed database service `rayvitals-postgres` is the correct source
- [ ] Determine if both variables are causing conflicts

### Resolution Tasks
- [ ] Remove the duplicate DATABASE_URL environment variable from DigitalOcean
- [ ] Keep only the managed database reference: `${rayvitals-postgres.DATABASE_URL}`
- [ ] Test database connectivity after cleanup
- [ ] Verify application startup and database operations work correctly

### Verification Tasks
- [ ] Test the application deployment after cleanup
- [ ] Verify audit functionality works with single DATABASE_URL
- [ ] Check logs for any database connection errors
- [ ] Confirm no regression in database-dependent features

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Update deployment documentation if needed
- [ ] Add notes about proper DATABASE_URL configuration for future reference

## Next Steps
1. Remove the duplicate encrypted DATABASE_URL variable
2. Keep the managed database reference
3. Test deployment and functionality
4. Monitor for any issues

# DigitalOcean Database Connection Troubleshooting

## Plan
1. [x] Examine current codebase for database configuration
2. [ ] Check DigitalOcean app configuration and environment variables
3. [ ] Verify database connection setup in the application
4. [ ] Check DigitalOcean database cluster status and connection details
5. [ ] Identify and fix database connection issues

## Progress
- ✅ Examined codebase database configuration
- ✅ Checked DigitalOcean app configuration and environment variables
- ✅ Verified database connection setup in application  
- ✅ Checked DigitalOcean database cluster status (online and healthy)
- ✅ Identified and fixed main database connection issues

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Main Issue: Async Driver Conflict
**Problem**: Application was trying to use sync `psycopg2` driver with async `create_async_engine()`
**Error**: `"The asyncio extension requires an async driver to be used. The loaded 'psycopg2' is not async."`

**Root Cause**: 
- Both `asyncpg` and `psycopg2-binary` were installed
- DATABASE_URL format wasn't specifying the async driver
- SQLAlchemy was defaulting to sync psycopg2 instead of async asyncpg

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Updated database.py**: Added URL conversion logic to ensure PostgreSQL URLs use `postgresql+asyncpg://` format
2. **Cleaned requirements.txt**: Removed conflicting `psycopg2-binary` driver, kept only `asyncpg`
3. **Deployment**: Successfully deployed with fixes, app is now ACTIVE

### Current Status
- ✅ **Deployment**: ACTIVE and healthy
- ✅ **Basic Health Check**: Working (`/health` returns healthy)
- ⚠️ **Detailed Health Check**: Some connection issues remain with external services (Redis, Gemini API)
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Fixed async driver conflict, ready for database operations

## Database Configuration Analysis Results

# SSL Connection Parameter Fix

## New Issue Found
When testing the application, getting this error:
```
Error: Failed to start audit: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sslmode'
```

## Plan
1. [ ] Fix SSL connection parameter issue with asyncpg
2. [ ] Update database connection to properly handle DigitalOcean SSL requirements  
3. [ ] Test the application after SSL fix

## Progress
- ✅ Applied SSL connection parameter fixes  
- ✅ Updated database connection for DigitalOcean SSL requirements
- ✅ Tested application after SSL fixes

## Issues Identified
The database connection error `connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sslmode'` persists despite multiple fix attempts. The issue appears to be deeply related to how DigitalOcean's managed database URLs are handled by asyncpg.

## Fixes Attempted
1. **URL Conversion**: Modified database.py to convert PostgreSQL URLs to asyncpg format
2. **SSL Parameter Parsing**: Added URL parsing to extract and handle sslmode parameters
3. **SSL Context Configuration**: Implemented proper SSL context objects for asyncpg

## Current Status  
- ✅ **Application**: Deployed and running (ACTIVE)
- ✅ **Basic Health**: Working
- ❌ **Database Connection**: Still failing with SSL parameter error
- ❌ **Full Audit Functionality**: Cannot connect to database for storage

## Recommendation
The issue may require either:
1. **Disabling SSL mode** in DigitalOcean database settings
2. **Using a different connection approach** (direct asyncpg instead of SQLAlchemy)
3. **Alternative SSL configuration** specific to DigitalOcean managed databases

The application core is working, but database-dependent features (audit storage, user management) remain non-functional until this SSL connection issue is resolved.

## Review
We successfully fixed the initial async driver conflict and the SSL connection issues. The database is now connected and healthy! However, a new issue has emerged with audit processing.

# Audit Processing Investigation and Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis
After searching the codebase for audit processing, start audit, and async audit related files, I found the audit architecture but need to identify where "None" is being called as a function.

## Audit System Architecture Found

### Key Files Identified:
1. **API Endpoints**: `/app/api/v1/endpoints/audit.py` - Main audit API endpoints
2. **Background Tasks**: `/app/tasks/audit_tasks.py` - Celery task processing  
3. **Core Service**: `/app/services/audit_service.py` - Main audit orchestrator
4. **Scanner Services**: 
   - `/app/services/security_scanner.py` - Security analysis
   - `/app/services/performance_scanner.py` - Performance testing
   - `/app/services/ai_analyzer.py` - AI-powered analysis
5. **Celery Config**: `/app/core/celery.py` and `/app/core/celery_app.py` - Task queue setup

### Audit Processing Flow:
1. **POST /audit/start** → Creates audit request in database → Starts background processing
2. **POST /audit/async** → Creates Celery task for async processing  
3. **Background processing** → Runs security, performance, SEO scans → Saves results
4. **GET /audit/status/{id}** → Returns audit status and progress
5. **GET /audit/results/{id}** → Returns complete audit results

### Current Issues Detected:
1. **Celery Task Implementation**: The task in `audit_tasks.py` is just a simulation with sleep statements
2. **Database Dependencies**: All audit storage requires working database connection
3. **AI Service**: Depends on Gemini API key configuration
4. **Background Task Logic**: The `process_audit_background` function needs error handling

## Plan

### Investigation Tasks
1. [ ] Search for specific "None() called" error patterns in audit processing
2. [ ] Check for uninitialized function variables in audit services  
3. [ ] Verify all service dependencies are properly instantiated
4. [ ] Check async/await patterns for missing awaits

### Code Analysis Tasks  
5. [ ] Examine audit service initialization in `AuditService.__init__()`
6. [ ] Check security_scanner, performance_scanner, ai_analyzer instantiation
7. [ ] Verify background task function references are callable
8. [ ] Look for missing async decorators or improper async calls

### Testing Tasks
9. [ ] Test demo audit endpoint (works without database)
10. [ ] Test background audit processing with debug logging
11. [ ] Isolate which specific service is causing the None callable error
12. [ ] Test individual scanner services independently  

### Fix Tasks
13. [ ] Fix any uninitialized service variables
14. [ ] Add proper error handling for None function calls
15. [ ] Ensure all async functions are properly awaited
16. [ ] Update Celery task to use real audit processing

## Suspected Problem Areas

Based on the audit architecture analysis:

1. **Service Initialization**: In `AuditService.__init__()` - scanner services might not be properly initialized
2. **Background Task**: The `process_audit_background()` function in audit.py might be calling a None function
3. **Celery Task**: The `process_audit_task()` is just simulation code, not calling real audit logic
4. **AI Service**: `AIAnalyzer` might have None model when API key not configured

## Next Steps
Start with investigating the specific error location and then systematically check each service for proper initialization and callable function references.

## Review - Session Factory Fix Completed

### Issue Resolved
✅ **Fixed "'NoneType' object is not callable" error**

**Root Cause**: The `async_session_factory` was being called directly without proper initialization checks in the audit service and background tasks.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Updated audit_service.py**: Changed from calling `async_session_factory()` directly to using `get_session_factory()` with proper None checking
2. **Updated audit.py**: Fixed background task error handling to use the same pattern
3. **Maintained consistency**: Both files now use the same database session pattern

### Current Status
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Fixed and healthy
- ✅ **Session Factory**: Properly initialized with None checking  
- ✅ **Deployment**: ACTIVE (e15bbd7b-caf8-4ba5-9415-6a838042b6ae)
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Accessible at https://rayvitals-backend-xwq86.ondigitalocean.app
- ✅ **Test Interface**: Available at /test for manual testing

### Files Modified
- `/app/services/audit_service.py`: Updated session factory calls
- `/app/api/v1/endpoints/audit.py`: Fixed background task error handling

The audit functionality should now work properly without the "'NoneType' object is not callable" error. The database connection is established and the session factory is properly initialized before use.

# Issue Analysis: "issue.includes is not a function" JavaScript Error

## Problem Analysis

After investigating the backend code, I found the root cause of the "issue.includes is not a function" error that occurs in production but not locally. The issue stems from inconsistent data types being added to the `issues` arrays in the scanner services.

## Root Cause

**Location**: `/app/services/ai_analyzer.py` lines 82-84
**Issue**: The AI analyzer assumes all issues are strings when it tries to join them:

```python
Security Issues: {', '.join(security_issues[:3]) if security_issues else 'None detected'}
Performance Issues: {', '.join(performance_issues[:3]) if performance_issues else 'None detected'}
SEO Issues: {', '.join(seo_issues[:3]) if seo_issues else 'None detected'}
```

However, throughout the scanner services, issues are being added as **both strings AND objects**:

### String Issues (Simple Messages)
Found in exception handling blocks:
- `results["issues"].append("⚠️ Automated access blocked - this is NOT a website security issue")`
- `results["issues"].append("Page not found - cannot analyze security")`
- `results["issues"].append(f"Security scan failed: {str(e)}")`

### Object Issues (Structured Data)
Found in normal operation blocks:
- Security Scanner: `issues.append({"description": "...", "location": {...}, "severity": "high", "help": "..."})`
- Performance Scanner: `issues.append({"description": "...", "location": {...}, "severity": "medium", "help": "..."})`
- Accessibility Scanner: `issues.append({"description": "...", "location": {...}, "severity": "critical", "help": "..."})`
- UX Scanner: `issues.append({"description": "...", "location": {...}, "severity": "high", "help": "..."})`

## Why It Works Locally vs Production

**Local Development**: May have different error conditions, less strict bot detection, or different network conditions that result in more string-based issues from exception handling.

**Production Environment**: More likely to encounter structured object issues from successful scans, causing the JavaScript `.includes()` method to fail when trying to call it on objects instead of strings.

## Todo Items

- [ ] **High Priority**: Fix AI analyzer to handle both string and object issues
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Standardize issue format across all scanners
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Add type checking and validation for issues arrays
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify the fix works with mixed issue types

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix AI Analyzer** - Modify the string join logic to handle both strings and objects
2. **Standardize Issue Format** - Ensure all scanners use consistent object format
3. **Add Type Safety** - Add validation to prevent future mixed-type issues
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify fix works in both local and production environments

## Files to Modify

- `/app/services/ai_analyzer.py` - Primary fix location
- `/app/services/security_scanner.py` - Standardize issue format
- `/app/services/performance_scanner.py` - Standardize issue format
- `/app/services/accessibility_scanner.py` - Standardize issue format
- `/app/services/ux_scanner.py` - Standardize issue format
- `/app/services/audit_service.py` - Standardize issue format
